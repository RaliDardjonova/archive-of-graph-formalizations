# Interesting (Essential) Theorems

This provides a list of essential theorems on graphs whose proofs should be compared among different representations.
Pointers to existing formalizations should be added.

## DAGs
- The strongly connected components of any graph form a DAG
- Any DAG has a topological numbering

## Undirected

## Both
